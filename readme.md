**UsefullStuff**
============
**What Is This?**
UsefullStuff is a bunch of useful stuff, mostly written in python. It's a bunch of scripts/commands. For example you want to download some files and to some operations with them, instead of writing giant shell scripts, or pythoning for hours, you can run a few commands, and you're done! Note: This is still in development, please don't use it for real yet. Fell free to fork and add some of your own scripts, I will probably accept the pull request.
